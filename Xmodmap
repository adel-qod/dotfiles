! Make alt work as control by assigning the key to the modifier.
! The following sets the left alt as ctrl while keeping ctrl working.
! It also sets the left super as Alt.
! Right side is left unchanged.
!
! First, clear the control and set it to both Control and Alt
clear control
add control = Control_L Control_R Alt_L Meta_L
! Second, clear the mod1 (the modifier that does the Meta/Alt job)
clear mod1
! Next clear (mod4 is the modifier that does the super job)
! is needed to stop the behavior of super because Super_L is
! assigned to it so it'll conflict with me assigning Super_L to mod1.
clear mod4
keycode 133 = Super_L
add mod1 = Alt_R Meta_R Super_L
! Finally, assign the right super as super function.
add mod4 = Super_R
